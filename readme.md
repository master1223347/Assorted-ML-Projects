# Assorted ML Projects

Welcome to **Assorted ML Projects**! This repository contains a collection of six Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different machine learning concepts and techniques. These notebooks are designed to help you learn and explore practical applications of machine learning step by step.

## Notebooks Overview

Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code examples, and visualizations to make learning easier. You can refer to them to understand concepts, experiment with code, and see real-world implementations.

The notebooks cover topics such as:

- Supervised learning (regression and classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Neural networks and deep learning basics
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Practical projects applying ML to real datasets
